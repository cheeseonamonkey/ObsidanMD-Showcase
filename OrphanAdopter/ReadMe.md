### Append to Clipboard
This button allows you to compile many links into the clipboard to easily paste connections into other files.

Each subsequent link will be appended to the clipboard on a new line.

>img

>img




### Post-processing

Post-processing allows you to append, prepend, or precede text to your links.

The contents of the *precede* text field will be placed before all of the links. This is useful to include a heading or label just before the list of links.

The *prepend* and *append* text fields will be added just before and after **each** link respectively. This can be useful to format lists or add extra line spacing (\\n).
