# Android Hardware Shortcuts

Improving the android app with [MacroDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid&hl=en_US&gl=US) integration.

### Gesture up/down on the fingerprint reader to fold/unfold headings:
This is super useful to me, I couldn't live without it any more. I often find it very frustrating to navigate in the app.

Obviously you can't see what I'm doing, *(I hope),* but here I'm just moving my finger on the fingerprint scanner (up to fold, down to unfold):

An idea for left/right gestures is to slide open the left and right panels, or to navigate forward and back.

### Shake device to close everything and go to homepage:
Any more than one panel on Android is a nightmare.

I usually only open one accidentally in the first place, then everything is so scrunched up together, and closing panes is hidden under a bunch of button presses, and is *right next* to the damn delete option.

Now I can simply return to my home page by shaking my device:

### Volume keys to cycle between Edit and Preview modes:
This one I don't use nearly as often as the others above, but the volume keys seem like an obvious shortcut trigger. If anyone has a good idea for a volume button shortcut I'd love to hear it.

Here I'm just just pushing the volume buttons on my phone:
