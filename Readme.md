## My Obsidan.MD Showcase

Cool stuff I've put together in [Obsidian.MD](https://obsidian.md).

Most of them are meta utilities, and many aim to improve the user experience of the mobile Android app.

Some of them will have their own Readmes.

## Contents:

### **OrphanAdopter**
Utility to help link connections between orphan files.

- very dynamic but a bit slow - it uses a lot of Javascript and has to query every single page in your vault
- requires **Dataview** plugin


### **File Management Queries**
Simple DataView queries but with advanced URI links. Generates links to *move* and *delete* without leaving the page at all. Used mainly for vault housekeeping and to manage newly-created files.

- very useful! those queried links are a *pain* to set up
- requires both the **DataView** and **Advanced Obsidian URI** plugins 
- I actually wrote for Reddit once a tutorial on how to do this: [reddit tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/rlljp9/dataview_queues_for_file_management_with_buttons/)
