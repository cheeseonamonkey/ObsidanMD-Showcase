# Shell - compress vault to tarball 

I used MacroDroid to trigger this on my phone, but results may vary with/without root privileges.

### Shell:

Entire script: ^2f2932

```sh
	
su
	
cd /storage/emulated/0/SyncThings
	
rm vaultCompressed.tar
	
rm vaultCompressed.tar.gz
	
tar cvf vaultCompressed.tar VaultieVault
	
gzip -9 vaultCompressed.tar
	
exit 
	
```


##### notes

Remove old tar
```
rm /storage/emulated/0/SyncThings/vaultCompressed.tar
```
Remove old gz:
```
rm /storage/emulated/0/SyncThings/vaultCompressed.tar.gz
```
new tar:
```
tar cvf vaultCompressed.tar /storage/emulated/0/SyncThings/VaultieVault
```
new gz (compress):
```
gzip -9 /storage/emulated/0/SyncThings/vault Compressed.tar
```
