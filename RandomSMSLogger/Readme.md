# Random SMS Logger:

[[Random SMS Log|This is just kind of cool]] and I wanted to share it.

Any time I get a text, there is a **10% chance** to trigger this macro.

It first anonymizes the data somewhat, then logs it to a file:

I don't really know what I can ever use it for but it was an interesting idea. I might turn it off also - I'm still not sure how to feel about logging messages in a raw txt file, anonymized or no.
