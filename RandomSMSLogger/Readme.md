# Random SMS Logger:

[[Random SMS Log|This is just kind of cool]] and I wanted to share it.

Any time I get a text, there is a **10% chance** to trigger this macro.

It first anonymizes the data somewhat, then logs it to a file:

Idk, its pretty new to me but I think it can give me an interesting timeline of my communications with people. Especially when linked to my Daily pages, or linked with mentions.

But I might stop it later - I'm still not sure how to feel about logging messages in a .txt file, lol.
